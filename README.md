## Synopsis

This is my fifth of a series of projects through Udacity's **Front End Web Development** course, through which I have been reviewing web fundamentals including HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.  This project incorporates the use of JavaScript libraries such as JQuery and Knockout to build a clean map application.  The website uses API calls to display the [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/ "Google Maps") as well as restaurant information from [Zomato](https://developers.zomato.com/documentation "Zomato").
